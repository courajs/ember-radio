Ember Radio
===========

NOTE: I'm still in the process of moving this from a proof-of-concept to a prototype. `bower install ember-radio` won't get you quite what you want yet. This gist should be enough for you to get started in the meantime: https://gist.github.com/FellowMD/84f5b113de2db762cb1d

A helper for working with radio buttons in Ember.js.


Installation
------------
With bower: `bower install ember-radio --save`
